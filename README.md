## Credits
The original plugin was made by my friend [@JorgenStenshaugen](https://github.com/JorgenStenshaugen), recently I did some updates in his plugin after 6.3 update hook, and I believe it could be helpfully for more people so I extracted this one functionality from addon and fix couple of issues and add feature to show multiple hits instead of one, update design, fix clear, positions etc.
